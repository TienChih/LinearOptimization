A sculptor and a painter work together to produce pieces of art, vases and figurines. The vases takes the sculptor 1 hour to make and the painter 2 hours to paint. The figurine takes the sculptor two hours to make and the painter 1 hour to paint. The sculptor has 35 hours a week to work and the painter has 40 hours a week to work.  Let denote the number of vases produced and denote the number of figurines produced.    Write two inequalities in terms of that represent the constraints on the time of the sculptor.    Write two inequalities in terms of that represent the constraints on the time of the painter.    Treating as and as , sketch the region on the cartesian plane satisfying all the above inequalities.    Suppose the vases sold for $100 and the figurines sold for $120.

Compare your final tableau to the initial tableau. Are there any similarities?      Consider canonical linear programming problem: Maximzie , subject to     Consider a sequence of pivots swapping ,  , . In each of these cases, what is the point of intersection?          If a series of pivots in accordance to allows one to return to a set of basic variables achieved earlier in the algorithm, we call this phenomena Cycling .      If a pivot on a tableau gives a new tableau corresponding to the same basic solution, we call the pivot a degenerate pivot.    Cycling is bad, since potentially this allows the Simplex Algorithm to not terminate. Fortunately, there is a solution to this issue.   Bland's Anticycling Rules   List all variables, independent and dependent in the initial tableau. Then consider the following rules:    Whenever there is more than one possible choice for a pivot row according to : select the row corresponding to the variable closest to the front of the initial list.    Whenever there is more than one possible choice for a pivot column according to : select the column corresponding to the variable closest to the front of the initial list.    Then the Simplex Algorthm will not cycle.     For the sake of notation, we denote the initial tableau: and order the variables in the associated way. Suppose we follow Bland's rules and still have cycling. That is, there is a sequence of pivots and bases (set of basic variables) . We call a variable  fickle if is in one, but not all of the bases. That is, it leaves a basis, and reenters it later during the cycle.  Note that in order for Cycling to occur, each pivot must be degenerate (ask yourself why?). So if is fickle, for each basic solution during the cycle.  Since the number of variables is finite, the set of fickle variables is also finite, and let denote the fickle variable with largest subscript. Suppose that (why must such a exist?). Denote the entering variable from with . Note that must also be fickle (why?) and so .  We call the dictionary for a basis the system of equations corresponding to that basis. So the dictionary for is which we can write as: Note that since the above pivot was valid, we must have that and since the pivot was degenerate, we have .  Now, because we have cycling, we must have that reenters the basis at some point Note that for this pivot to be valid, we have that . If we let denote the dictionary before re-enters the basis, we have: So note that the solution space to the system of equations for both these dictionaries are the same. So we have a solution for (not neccessarily feasible ie non-negativity may fail) that must also be a solution to :   So we have where for . So via algebra:   The above equation holds true no matter what is. Thus: Note that , NOT is entering the basis. If is already in the basis, .
