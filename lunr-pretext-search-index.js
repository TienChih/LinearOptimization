A sculptor and a painter work together to produce pieces of art, vases and figurines. The vases takes the sculptor 1 hour to make and the painter 2 hours to paint. The figurine takes the sculptor two hours to make and the painter 1 hour to paint. The sculptor has 35 hours a week to work and the painter has 40 hours a week to work.  Let denote the number of vases produced and denote the number of figurines produced.    Write two inequalities in terms of that represent the constraints on the time of the sculptor.    Write two inequalities in terms of that represent the constraints on the time of the painter.    Treating as and as , sketch the region on the cartesian plane satisfying all the above inequalities.    Suppose the vases sold for $100 and the figurines sold for $120.

Consider canonical linear programming problem: Maximzie , subject to     Consider a sequence of pivots swapping ,  , . In each of these cases, what is the point of intersection?          If a series of pivots in accordance to allows one to return to a set of basic variables achieved earlier in the algorithm, we call this phenomena Cycling .      If a pivot on a tableau gives a new tableau corresponding to the same basic solution, we call the pivot a degenerate pivot.    Cycling is bad, since potentially this allows the Simplex Algorithm to not terminate. Fortunately, there is a solution to this issue.   Bland's Anticycling Rules   List all variables, independent and dependent in the initial tableau. Then consider the following rules:    Whenever there is more than one possible choice for a pivot row according to : select the row corresponding to the variable closest to the front of the initial list.    Whenever there is more than one possible choice for a pivot column according to : select the column corresponding to the variable closest to the front of the initial list.    Then the Simplex Algorthm will not cycle.     For the sake of notation, we denote the initial tableau:                                                                                                                                     and order the variables in the associated way. Suppose we follow Bland's rules and still have cycling. That is, there is a sequence of pivots and bases (set of basic variables) . We call a variable  fickle if is in one, but not all of the bases. That is, it leaves a basis, and reenters it later during the cycle.  Note that in order for Cycling to occur, each pivot must be degenerate (ask yourself why?). So if is fickle, for each basic solution during the cycle.  Since the number of variables is finite, the set of fickle variables is also finite, and let denote the fickle variable with largest subscript. Suppose that (why must such a exist?). Denote the entering variable from with .                                                                                                                                                                                              Note that must also be fickle (why?) and so .  We call the dictionary for a basis the system of equations corresponding to that basis. So the dictionary for is which we can write as: Note that since the above pivot was valid, we must have that and since the pivot was degenerate, we have .  Now, because we have cycling, we must have that reenters the basis at some point                                                                                                                                                                                                  Note that for this pivot to be valid, we have that . If we let denote the dictionary before re-enters the basis, we have: So note that the solution space to the system of equations for both these dictionaries are the same. So we have a solution for (not neccessarily feasible ie non-negativity may fail) that must also be a solution to :   So we have where for . So via algebra:   The above equation holds true no matter what is. Thus: Note that , NOT is entering the basis. If is already in the basis, . Otherwise, , otherwise would have entered by Bland's Anticyling rules. We've also shown . Thus which is only possible if there is some such that   From this, we know that . So , but , so is fickle.

If we follow then no basis is visited twice during the Simplex Algorithm. Note that is non-decreasing with each pivot. Must the Simplex Algorithm terminate? Why?    "

A pint of healing elixer takes 3 newt eyes and one frog, whereas a pint of poison takes 1 each of newt eyes and frogs. She currently has 34 newt eyes and 14 frogs.  Supposing that the healing elixer sells for three gold pieces, and the poison sells for two. Agnesi wishes to maximzie her revenue. Let us suppose that since these are liquids, she is happy making fractional amounts of elixers and potions.   The name Agnesi was chosen by popular consensus in my Math 346 Spring 2024 class, due to Maria Agnesi's iconic curve.     Sketch the feasible region for this problem, and use whatever method you feel like to find the optimal solution.        Agnesi is frustrated by her production levels and income. She is going to recruit some local children to gather more materials for her. Without explicitly computing anything, looking at her situation, what would result in greater profits for her, more newt eyes or frogs?    Recompute this linear program with 35 newt eyes and 14 frogs, then with 34 new eyes and 15 frogs. Which provides the greater increase in revenue? Is this consistent with what you thought earlier?    If the need for healing elixer increases and they now sell for 5 gold, would that change our answer?      In both and we esentially explore the idea of assigning values somehow to the bounds of a maximization problem.  If you have a production problem, and wish to assign a value to all your materials, which of the following should be reasonable things to expect from these values?    The value of each material is non-negative.    The total value of the materials should be as big as possible.    The total value of the materials should be as small as possible.    The total value of these materials should be greater than or equal to the value of selling products made with those materials.    All materials must have non-zero value.    If a material is ever used, it has zero value.        From , letting denote the number of healing elixers, and denote the amount of poison created. Then, we get that the feasible region satisfies the inequalities: which is bounded by hyperplanes: with normal vectors which may be depicted:   The feasible region for the witch production problem, and depicted normal vectors.      For any , the objective plane is with normal vector .  For each extreme point in the feasible region, express the normal vector for the objective plane as a linear combination of the normal vectors of the planes whose intersect at said point.     Starting at the basic solution, perform pivots as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              For each tableau, confirm the solution is feasible. Then look at the objective row, is there anything familiar about those values?    For each tableau above, if I decrease each decision variable from to , how does that change the value of the objective function? What does decreasing a decision variable from to mean geometrically? What does it mean in terms of the normal vectors of the associated intersecting hyperplanes?    For which extreme point is the normal vector of the objective plane a linear combination of the normal vectors of intersecting hyperplanes using only positive coefficients? How is that reflected in the corresponding tableau? Is there anything special about the corresponding solution?      Consider the tableau:                                                                                                                                        Suppose that for each plane has corresponding normal vector .    Prove that the normal vector for is .    Is there anything special about a tableau where is a non-negative linear combination of normal vectors?    Suppose that this tableau corresponds to an optimal solution. If we decrease any from to , how does change? What does this decrease correspond to geometrically?

  "body": " Min-Max Games    Suppose we have two players, then Even player and the Odd player. Each player picks an integer from 1-3.    If the sum is even:   If the chosen numbers are distinct, then the Odd player pays the Even player the difference between the numbers.    If the chosen numbers are the same, then the Odd player pays the Even player the sum of the numbers.       If the sum is odd: the Even player pays the Odd player $3.      Record the net winnings to the Even player in the following table:            Odd                                             Even                                                      Examinine this table, and comparing the rows, is there any advantage to the Even player in picking the first row over the third row?    Comparing the columns, is there any advantage to the Odd player in picking the third column over the first column?    Delete any row (column) corresponding to a choice that the Even (Odd) player would never make.  If the Even player always picks a 2, what is the optimal strategy for the Odd player? Similarly if the Odd player always picks a 1, what is the optimal strategy for the even player?    Do either player gain any advantage by picking a single choice and sticking to it?    Suppose the Even player flips a coin to make their choice, if the Odd player picks a 1, what is their average expected winnings? What if they choose a 2?    Suppose the Odd player flips a coin to make their choice, if the Even player picks a 2, what is their average expected winnings? What if they choose a 3?    Does this game favor either the Even or Odd player?      In a two-player zero-sum game, where the row player has choices and the column player has choices, the payoff matrix is a matrix which records in each row and column the net payoff to the row player (this choice is purely by convention, but we will stick to it.)  If a row has entries that are strictly greater than or equal to the entries of another row , then we say that row  dominates row . We then may delete row since there is now reason the row player would choose . Similarly, if column is less than or equal to column , column  dominates column and we may delete column .

  "body": " A Transportation problem and VAM    Suppose we have a company moving goods (lets say widgets) from 3 different warehouses to 3 different markets. The cost of shipping from warehouses to markets is listed below, along with the demand from each market and the supply available at each warehouse:       Market 1  Market 2  Market 3      Warehouse 1  $2\/ton  $1\/ton  $2\/ton  40 tons    Warehouse 2  $9\/ton  $4\/ton  $7\/ton  60 tons    Warehouse 3  $1\/ton  $2\/ton  $9\/ton  10 tons      40 tons  50 tons  20 tons  110 tons     We want to ship the goods from the warehouses to the markets in a way that minimizes costs.    Let denote the the tons of goods shipped from warehouse to market .  Write an (in)equality for the quantity of goods shipped from Warehouse 1 in terms of the .    Write an (in)equality for the quantity of goods shipped to Market 2 in terms of the .    Write a (possibly noncanonical) linear minimization program that minimizes the cost to ship these goods.      A transportation problem where the total demand and the total supply are the same is a balanced transportation problem.      While we could solve this transportation by the simplex algorithm, it would be painfully tedious to do. We develop an algorithm to simplify this process.     Suppose we had warehouses and markets with supplies and demands . We have linear equations . Since , what is the maximum number of that can be non-zero for a basic solution?   Imagine an augmented matrix with the coefficients of the on one side and the supplies\/demand of the other. What is an upper bound of the rank of this matrix. Then consider that . What does this say about the (in)dependence of the rows? What then must the rank be?    We first mark the difference between the lowest two values in each row\/column:       1  1  5      1  2  1  2  40    3  9  4  7  60    1  1  2  9  10      40  50  20       A table like this is called a transportation tableau .  Ideally we would always want to move everything with the cheapest available option. It's not hard to see that in most cases, like this one, this isn't actually possible. What do these numbers we computed measure? How can they help us decide how to move goods?

To summarise the Vogel Advanced-Start Method or VAM method of producing a feasible solution to the transportation problem is outlined as follows.    We begin with sources and sinks, each with a supply or demand respectively. We associate each row of the transportation tableau with a source, each column with a sink, and each entry with the cost of shipping from source to sink .    For each row and column, we record the difference between the lowest two values.    We pick the row\/column with the largest difference (so long as the associated supply\/demand is positive), and the smallest entry in the row\/column, . By convention we circle this entry.    We ship quantity from source to sink , recording this quantity as a superscript in the numerator and adjusting the supply for source and demand for sink appropriately.    We ignore any source\/sink with 0 supply\/demand and repeat 2-4.    If all source\/sinks are exhausted and we have not yet circled entries, we circle any entries in the last row\/column we've examined, noting that the quantities shipped for these entries is zero.    Once entries are circled and all supply\/demand is exhausted, we terminate. The circled entries are called the basis of the tableau.      "
