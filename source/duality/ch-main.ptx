  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the fundamental ideas of linear optimization is that of duality.  We saw a precursor
      to this idea in both <xref ref="activity-widget"/> and <xref ref="activity-insurance"/>.
      The same initial scenario produces both a maximization and a minimization problem.  What does
      this mean, why does this occur, and what are the relations between these problems?

    <p>
      In this chapter, we define and explore the notion of duality in linear optimization.  In <xref ref="sec-sensitivity"/>
      we give a geometric and algebraic interpretation of dual variables and the dual problem.  In <xref ref="sec-dualitytheory"/> 
      we use geometric reasoning to guide proofs of powerful duality results connecting the primal and dual problems.  Finally, in
      <xref ref="sec-dualpivot"/> we show how the simplex pivot from <xref ref="ch-simplex"/> applies geometrically and computationally
      to the dual problem, and show how Tucker tableaus encode the dual problem.
