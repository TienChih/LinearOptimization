  <title>The Simplex Algorithm</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw that in lower dimensions one may use geometric reasoning to
      find and interpret the optimal solution to a linear optimization problem.  However,
      this intuition easily breaks down in higher dimensions.  Moreover, 
      brute force examination of potential corner points proves to be a massive and overwhelming
      approach to finding optimal solutions.  Is there any way we can leverage this intuition built
      in lower dimensions to develop a systematic way to identify the optimal extreme point?

      In this chapter, we develop an algorithm, the Simplex Algorithm, which allows us to
      solve linear optimization problems. In <xref ref="sec-pivot"/> we determine
       the rules for a simplex pivot
      and interpret this operation computationally, algebraically and
      geometrically.  In <xref ref="sec-simplexmax"/> we discover the conditions for
      an appropriate pivot which preserves feasibility, as well as how to handle basic solutions
      which are infeasible, and minimization problems.  In <xref ref="sec-cycling"/> we discuss
      <em>cycling</em>, and how to avoid it with Bland's Anticycling Rules.  Finally in <xref ref="sec-simplexsage"/>
      we show how the programming language Sage may be used to remove some of the computational tedium of solving
      these problems.
