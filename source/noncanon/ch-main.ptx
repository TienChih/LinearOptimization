    <p>
      Thus far, we have focused on <em>canonical</em> optimization problems where each decision variable is non-negative,
      and all bounds are inequalities.  However, what would happen if we relaxed, or strengthened these conditions?

    <p>
      In this chapter, we explore noncanonical optimization problems.  In <xref ref="sec-unconstrained"/> we consider 
      the possibility of potentially negative decision variables, and explore the algebraic and geometric interpretations of
      this phenomena.  In <xref ref="sec-superconstrained"/> we do the same for bounds defined by equality conditions, rather than 
      inequalities.  In <xref ref="sec-noncanonsage"/> we show how to encode and solve non-canonical linear optimization using Sage.
