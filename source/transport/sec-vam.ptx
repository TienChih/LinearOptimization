      <p>
        Suppose we have a company moving goods (lets say widgets) from 3 different warehouses to
        3 different markets.  The cost of shipping from warehouses to markets is listed below, along with
        the demand from each market and the supply available at each warehouse:

        We want to ship the goods from the warehouses to the markets in a way that minimizes costs.

          Let <m>x_{ij}</m> denote the cost to ship a ton of goods from warehouse <m>i</m> to
