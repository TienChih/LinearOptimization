  <title>The Transportation &amp; Assignment Problems</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
       Another application of linear optimization is shipping
       goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations in a way
       that minimizes costs while satisfying all supply and demand needs.
       A related task is assigning entities to tasks in a way that minimizes
       cost or maximizes utility.  While these may be modeled as linear
       optimization problems, we also discuss some algorithms which computes
       these solutions in a less unweildy manner.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec-vam"/>, we discuss the general transportation problem
      and an algorithm which heuristically produces a <q>good</q> feasible solution.  Then
      in <xref ref="sec-transportalgorithm"/> we explore an algorithm which improves
      a feasible solution and produces an optimal solution.  Then in <xref ref="sec-assignment"/>,
      we examine a specific type of transportation problem, the assignment problem,
      and study an algorithm particular to this class of problem.
