        Consider a series of islands with bridges between them.  A group of people are trying to move from island <m>v_0</m> to island <m>v_5</m>.  Due to the length/width
        of the bridges, only but so many people can move between a pair of islands in a minute, and these are labled.  The bridges also only allow movement in one direction.

        A <em>directed graph</em> or <em>network</em> is a pair <m>D=(V, E)</m> where <m>V</m> is a set of
        vertices and <m>E</m> is a set of ordered pairs of distinct elements of <m>V</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A network is <em>capacitated</em> if for each edge <m>(v_i, v_j)\in E</m>
        we assign a non negative capacity <m>c_{ij}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>flow</em> assigned to a capacitated network is an assignment to each edge
        <m>(v_i, v_j)\in E</m>, a value <m>x_{ij}</m> such that <m>0\leq x_{ij}\leq c_{ij}</m>.

        Graph theory is a rich, complex and deep area of study.  Graph Theorists study a variety
        of graphs or objects called graphs, with a wide range of conventions.  For the purposes of
        this chapter, graphs are directed, there is at most two edges between graphs (one in each direction),
        and loops are disallowed.  Note that in general some or any of these conventions can be modified or removed.
