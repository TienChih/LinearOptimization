  <title>Network Flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we focus on flows through directed graphs called
      <em>networks</em>.  While graph theory is an enormous area of math
      (in which I work), we are particularly interested in optimization problems
      on weighted and or capacitated networks, such as maximizing the flow through
      a network with limited capacity, or finding a path minimizing the distance between
      nodes.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec-networkflow"/> we explore maximal flows through capacitated
      networks and model this problem with linear optimization.  In <xref ref="sec-maxflowmincut"/>
      we discuss the dual problem, connect it to <em>cuts</em> in the network, and discuss algorithms
      which solve both problems.  In <xref ref="sec-weighted"/> we shift
      our attention to weighted networks, and examine shortest paths and minimum cost flows.
