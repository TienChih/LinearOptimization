    <title>A note on the print version</title>

    <p>
      This book aims to develop readers' ability to reason about
      linear optimization concepts, and to facilitate thinking and intuition.
      Several technological tools are deployed to this effect, to enhance
      geometric reasoning, bypass tedious arithmetic computations, or both.
      These include embedded Sage cells with executable code, Doenet activities,
      and Desmos graphs.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      <!--
      The online version of this book has many embedded Sage cells
      that allow readers to perform computations from within the
      book.
      -->
      Sage is introduced as
      a platform for performing many computations
      since it is freely available and its syntax mirrors common
      mathematical notation. Print readers may access Sage online through
      <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">.</url>
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the book, Sage cells appear in various places to
      encourage readers to use Sage to complete some relevant
      computation.  In the print version, these may appear with some
      pre-populated code, such as the one below, that you will want to
      copy into an online Sage cell.
      <sage>
	<input>
A = matrix([[1,2], [2,1]])
	</input>
      </sage>
      Some activities call for the students to determine the appropriate parameters which would allow Sage to solve the
      question at hand.  In these cases, <c>FIXME</c> or similar place holders are placed within the code, and meant to be edited out
      in favor of the correct entries
      <sage>
        <input>
    A = matrix(FIXME)
    rref(A)
        </input>
          </sage>
      Empty cells appear as shown below and are included to indicate
      part of an exercise or activity that is meant to be completed in
      Sage. 
      <sage>
	<input>

	</input>
      </sage>
    </p>

    <p>
        For other interactive components to activities, the pdf and print versions of this text will contain links and QR codes to a standalone
        version of the activity, so that readers with an appropriate device may follow along the flow of the course.

    <p>
        In this section, I provide two additional such interactives.  One is a Desmos linear optimization visualizer and solver for
        two dimensional problems:
        <interactive desmos="rwbqdwjfht" width="100%"/>
        The other is a Desmos 3d version of this interactive for three dimensions.
        <interactive iframe="https://www.desmos.com/3d/15yyp0qdym" width="100%" />
        These tools can help you visualize and solve small dimensional problems and can be very helpful for beginners.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will be an upcoming interactive provided when it is ready ðŸ˜‰.
