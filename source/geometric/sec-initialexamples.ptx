  <title>Initial Examples</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Here we begin with some initial examples motivating the sort of problems we will study. We define the central problems
      around which the course will revolve.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A sculptor and a painter work together to produce pieces of art, vases and figurines.  The vases takes the sculptor 1 hour to make and the painter 2 hours to paint.  
        The figurine takes the sculptor two hours to make and the painter 1 hour to paint.  
        The sculptor has 35 hours a week to work and the painter has 40 hours a week to work.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Let <m>x_1</m> denote the number of vases produced and <m>x_2</m> denote the number of figurines produced.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What other inequalities involving <m>x_1, x_2</m> would be sensible to impose?

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Treating <m>x_1</m> as <m>x</m> and <m>x_2</m> as <m>y</m>, sketch the region on the cartesian plane satisfying all the above inequalities.
          We will refer to this as the <term>feasible region</term>.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Pick some points within this feasible region, what do they represent
          in terms of vases and figurines?  How much revenue is generated?  What causes
          the revenue to increase or decrease?
        </p>
        
      </statement>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the vases sold for $100 and the figurines sold for $120.  Without reading ahead, what would or could you do to solve this problem?  What kind of things would you need to consider?
        </p>
        <p>
          For those of you who had Calculus and especially Multivariable Calculus, what ideas from those course might you employ?  What are some limitations of these ideas?

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Suppose Carlos planning on shopping for a meal.  Mini bell peppers are $1.00 (simplified) a pound, Chicken is $1.25 a pound and Spaghetti with sauce is $0.80 a cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pound of Bell Peppers has 500 units of vitamin A, 30 calories and 10 units of calcium.   A pound of Chicken has 75 units of vitamin A, 280 calories and 22 units of calcium.  A cup of Spaghetti with sauce has 2000 units of Vitamin A, 240 Calories and 52 units of Calcium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carlos needs a minimum of 640 calories, 1650 units of Vitamin A and 500 units of Calcium.

        Let <m>x_1</m> denote pounds of bell pepper, <m>x_2</m> denote pounds of chicken and <m>x_3</m> denote cups of spaghetti with sauce.  Find three inequalities in terms of the <m>x_i</m> for how much of each food Carlos should eat to meet his minimum dietary requirements.

        How might we solve this problem?  How is it different from <xref ref="activity-exampleart"/>?

    <statement>
      <p>
        This seems like a wildly oversimplistic dietary problem, because it is.  How might we complicate it for more realism?
