  <title>Summary of <xref ref="ch-geometric"/></title>

  <p>
    We introduced some basic examples of linear optimization problems in
    <xref ref="activity-exampleart"/> and <xref ref="activity-examplediet"/>.  In these
    examples, we were able to graphically analyze and show that they reach optimality,
    and that these optimal solutions occur on the boundary of the feasible region.
    This is an idea which is critical to the development of our theory.
  </p>

  <p>
    To show that such a result may generalize, we introduce the notion of
    <em>convexity</em> <xref ref="def-convex"/>.  A convex set is a set which contains every
    line segement between points in the set.  We then show that a half-space was convex,
    that an intersection of halfspaces was convex, and thus the feasible region of a linear optimization 
    problem is always convex.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note then that for a linear function <m>f(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)=\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^m c_j x_j</m>,
    that for any output of <m>f</m>, <m>k</m>, the equation <me> \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^m c_j x_j =k</me>
    form a plane in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, and that for any <m>\x'</m> lying on this plane, <m>f(\x')=k</m> as well.
    We may increase the value of <m>k</m> by moving in one of two direction orthogonal to this
    plane, until we reach the boundary.  But even then, we can still increase the value of <m>k</m> by moving along the boundary until
    we either fall on a subset of the boundary on which <m>f</m> is constant, or a corner point also called
    an <em>extreme point</em> <xref ref="def-extremepoint"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, if a linear optimization problem admits a maximum solution, it must do so at some extreme point.
    Each extreme point is an intersection of hyperplanes, but in <m>\mathbb{R}^m</m> with <m>k</m> additional
    bounding hyperplanes, there could be <m>{m+k\choose m}</m> intersections, not all of whom
    are feasible, and not all of whom are optimal.  There is also no guarantee that a linear
    optimization problem admits an optimal solution at all.  This motivates us to find a more
    systematic approach to obtaining optimal solutions.
