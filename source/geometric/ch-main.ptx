  <title>Geometric Linear Optimization</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      The purpose of this chapter is to establish the geometric intuition that
      undergird the approach we take to this material throughout the course.  In 
      <xref ref="sec-intro"/>, we revisit some ideas from Linear Algebra and explore
      the connection between algebraic operations and geometric interpretations.  This is
      <em>not</em> meant to serve as a review of Linear Algebra prerequisites, but as a
      warm up that centers the geometric intuition.  In <xref ref="sec-initial"/>, we give
      some examples of problems we wish to address in this course and show how we may interpret
      them geometrically.  In <xref ref="sec-polyhedralconvex"/>, we describe the geometric
      notions which will be most useful to us throughout the course, and give formal and intuitive
      descriptions of these ideas.
