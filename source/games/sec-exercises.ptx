          For the following games, write out the payoff matrix and the
          reduced matrix after domination.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Rowan has a 3 of hearts, 4 of spades, 9 of spades  and 10 of hearts.
            Colleen has a 5 of spades, 6 of hearts, 7 of hearts  and 8 of spades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each player selects a card without revealing it, and both players flip their
            cards over at the same time.  If the suits are the same, then Rowan wins the sum of the two card values.
            Otherwise, Colleen wins that sum.

          <p>
            Rowan picks an even integer from 1-6, and Colleen picks an
            odd integer from 1-6.  If the difference is less than 3, the
            player who played the bigger number wins the sum of the two values.
            Otherwise the player who played the smaller number wins the sum of
            the two values.

            Rowan picks an integer from 1-3.  Colleen picks two guesses
            which may be the same.  Colleen reveals her guesses one at a time.
            If she guesses correctly, she wins a number of dollars equal to the value of their other guess.  
            If she does not guess correctly, Rowan wins a number of dollars equal to the sum of both
            guesses.

        <title>Colonel Blotto</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Colonel Rowan is attacking a town defended by Colonel Colleen.  Rowan
            has three regiments and Colleen has four.  There are two routes to the town.
            Rowan and select any number of regiments to attack along each route, up to a total of three
            and Colleen can likewise assign her four regiments along either route, neither
            knowing beforehand the other's strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along each route, whatever side has a greater number of regiments wins points
            equal to the number of regiments sent by the opposing side (as they capture those
            units).  Furthermore, if Rowan wins along either route, he captures the town
            also worth one point.

          <p>
            Rowan and Colleen each simultaneously hold up one or two fingers and 
            shouts a guess for the total number of fingers held.  If either Rowan or Colleen
            guess correctly, then they collect dollars from their opponent equal to this number of fingers.
            If they both guess correctly or both guess incorrectly, then no money changes hands.

            Both players secretly flip a coin, they see their own result but not the other.
            Suppose Heads is greater value than Tails.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rowan then has two choices.  He may <em>CALL</em>: both coins are revealed.
            If Rowan wins, Colleen gives him $2, if Colleen wins, Rowan gives her $4.  If
            both are the same, no money changes hands.  He may <em>BID</em>: Colleen then has
            two choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colleen may <em>FOLD</em>: and Rowan wins $4.  Or she may <em>SEE</em>: in
            which case both coins are revealed, and the winner is awarded $10 from the loser.
            If there is no winner, no money changes hands.

            Each player adds $2 to the pot.  Then they roll a 4-sided dice in secret.

          </p>
          <p>
            Rowan two options.  He may <em>FOLD</em>:  The pot goes to Colleen.  He may
            <em>PLAY</em>: In which case he adds $5 to the pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colleen then has two options.  She may <em>FOLD</em>:  The pot goes to Rowan.  She may
            <em>PLAY</em>: In which case she adds $5 to the pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the results are revealed.  Whoever wins takes the pot.  If they are a tie,

            There are 6 cards, 2 Jacks, 2 Queens and 2 Kings with Jack &lt; Queen &lt; King.
            The players each place $1 in the pot.
            Then, one card each is dealt to each player face down.  They may see their own card but not their opponent's.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rowan now has three choices.  He may <em>FOLD</em>:  the pot goes to Colleen.
            He may <em>CHECK</em>: the pot remains as is, or he may <em>RAISE</em>:
            Rowan adds $2 to the pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Rowan doesn't FOLD, Colleen also has three choices.  She may also
            <em>FOLD</em>: The pot goes to Rowan.  She may <em>SEE</em>: Colleen adds money
            to the pot equal to what Rowan added (if any).  She may <em>SEE-RAISE</em>:
            Colleen adds money to the pot equal to what Rowan added, and then they both add in an additional
            $2.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no one has folded at this point, the cards are revealed.  The pot goes to the winner.
            If the cards are a tie, then the pot is split evenly between the players.
