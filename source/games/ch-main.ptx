  <introduction>
    <p>
      We begin the first of several chapters on applications of
      linear optimization beyond the more straight forward examples
      we've seen so far, further highlighting the power and versatility
      of this theory.  This particular chapter is about competitive
      <em>zero-sum</em> games.  Two players playing against each other
      in some game with finite choices may find that the efficacy of a choice
      depends on their opponents choice.  A good choice in one scenario may be
      a poor choice in another.  Moreover, if one always makes the same choices,
      your opponent may be able to anticipate this move, so it makes sense to
      vary your choices.  How should one vary them, and how might your opponent vary theirs?  Questions like this are
      part of an area of mathematics called <em>Game Theory</em>.

      In <xref ref="sec-minmaxgames"/> we describe these games and propose
      a scheme to solve for the optimal strategy for both players.  In 
      <xref ref="sec-vonneumann"/> we prove that this strategy is valid and that
      optimal strategies exist.  Then in <xref ref="sec-chance"/> we see how to apply
      these principles to games with random components.

      We note that in this chapter, we deal quite a bit with randomness and probability.
      One is encouraged to review basic probability theory in <xref ref="sec-probreview"/>
      and in particular, the definition of the <term>expected value</term>
      <xref ref="def-expectation"/>.
