      <p>
        Suppose we have two players, then <q>Even</q> player and the <q>Odd</q> player.  Each player picks an integer from 1-3.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the sum is even:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If the chosen numbers are distinct, then the Odd player pays the Even player the difference between the numbers.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If the chosen numbers are the same, then the Odd player pays the Even player the sum of the numbers.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the sum is odd: the Even player pays the Odd player $3.

  <definition xml:id="def-payoff">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a two-player zero-sum game, where the row player has <m>n</m> choices and the column player has <m>m</m> choices, the
         <em>payoff matrix</em> is a matrix which records in each row and column the net payoff to the row player (this choice is purely
         by convention, but we will stick to it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If a row <m>i</m> has entries that are strictly greater than or equal to the entries of another row <m>j</m>, 
        then we say that row <m>i</m> <em>dominates</em> row <m>j</m>.  We then may delete row <m>j</m> since there is now reason the row player would
        choose <m>j</m>.  Similarly, if column <m>i</m> is less than or equal to column <m>j</m>, column <m>i</m> 
        <em>dominates</em> column <m>j</m> and we may delete column <m>j</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
