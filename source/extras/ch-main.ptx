  <introduction>
    <p>
      This is a chapter on assorted applications of linear optimization
      that are not generally a standard part of the undergraduate course, but
      are fun and nifty extensions.  There is a good chance that anyone 
      taking or teaching a class on linear optimization will not be able to cover
      these topics.  However, for a class who finds the time, as independent
      reading for an ambitious or curious student, or fodder for projects or
      exploration, these can provide some insight into the vast array of problems
      to which the theory from this course may be applied.

      In <xref ref="sec-covermatch"/>, we discuss
      graph matchings and coverings using linear optimization.  In <xref ref="sec-sudoku"/> linear optimization
      is used to solve sudoku and sudoku like puzzles.  
      In <xref ref="sec-scheduling"/> scheduling problems are modeled as and solved as 
      linear optimization problems.  Finally, <xref ref="sec-altduality"/> provides an alternative
      approach to the proof of the Strong Duality Theorem <xref ref="thm-strongduality"/>.
