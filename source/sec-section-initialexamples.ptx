  <p> Here we begin with some initial examples motivating the sort of problems we will study. </p>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A sculptor and a painter work together to produce pieces of art, vases and figurines.  The vases takes the sculptor 1 hour to make and the painter 2 hours to paint.  
        The figurine takes the sculptor two hours to make and the painter 1 hour to paint.  
        The sculptor has 35 hours a week to work and the painter has 40 hours a week to work.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Let <m>x_1</m> denote the number of vases produced and <m>x_2</m> denote the number of figurines produced.
      </p>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write two inequalities in terms of <m>x_1, x_2</m> that represent the constraints on the time of the sculptor.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Write two inequalities in terms of <m>x_1, x_2</m> that represent the constraints on the time of the painter.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Treating <m>x_1</m> as <m>x</m> and <m>x_2</m> as <m>y</m>, sketch the region on the cartesian plane satisfying all the above inequalities.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the vases sold for $100 and the figurines sold for $120.  Without reading ahead, what would or could you do to solve this problem?  What kind of things would you need to consider?
