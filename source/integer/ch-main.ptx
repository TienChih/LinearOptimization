  <title>Integer Optimization</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Thus far, we have been exploring problems where the solution
      space consists of real-valued vectors.  However, in some contexts, like in
      <xref ref="ch-transport"/> and <xref ref="ch-flow"/>, it is sensible
      to imagine that fractional or irrational solutions may not make sense in the
      real-world contexts of those problems.  It's also not a stretch to imagine 
      more classical production-type problems where only integral units would be possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cases where real valued and integer valued optimal solutions may differ, some care
      must be taken to solve for the optimal integer valued solution.  In 
      <xref ref="sec-branchbound"/>, we explore one potential algorithm which is algebraically
      driven, and in <xref ref="sec-cuttingplane"/>, we discuss an alternative algorithm which is
      geometrically focused.
