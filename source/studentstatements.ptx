    <q>I really liked how the textbook built up the ideas in a way that made the motivation behind each concept and theorem feel natural. The order that the material was presented in made sense, and it was clear why each new technique was introduced. I also appreciated that we often derived or proved results ourselves before seeing the formal version - it made everything fit together more logically and helped me actually understand why things work instead of just memorizing them. On top of that, the emphasis on the geometric perspective really deepened my understanding; seeing how the concepts connect visually made linear programming feel much more intuitive.</q>

    <q>I enjoyed the inquiry-based classroom experience - it transformed each class into an exciting research project. I felt a great sense of achievement when my peers and I collaborated to prove important theorems and explored how linear optimization applies to real-world scenarios. The excitement of discovery not only deepened my understanding of mathematics but also fostered lasting friendships and unforgettable memories.</q>
