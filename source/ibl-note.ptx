    <title>A note on inquiry learning</title>

    <p>
      The four pillars of Inquiry Learning are the cornerstone around which this text was built.
      For those who wish to learn now, I highly reccomend Dr. Dana Ernst's blog on this
      subject <url href="https://danaernst.com/resources/inquiry-based-learning/">https://danaernst.com/resources/inquiry-based-learning/.</url>
    </p>

    

    <p>
      Some care must be taken to ensure that the class flows in a productive way,
      and that students are equitably engaged, and are given agency to take ownership of their
      own learning.  Some judicious instructor intervention may occasionally be neccesary,
      but this text facilitates a student centered, deep and engaging learning experience.

    <p>
      While it may be possible for a student to work through this text on their own,
      it is designed to facilitate discussion between students, and between the class and the
      instructor.  There is truly where this material come to life.

      a screen, and for students to use whatever computing devices they have available,
      to access this text, use the provided tools, and collaborate on working through this material.
