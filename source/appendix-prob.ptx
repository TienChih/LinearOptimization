    <title>Probability Theory Review</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This is an extremely brief <q>review</q> of the limited probability
            theory we utilize in <xref ref="ch-games"/>.  It's not even
            particularly fair to call this a review, since probability is not
            a prerequisite to this course.  However, the limited amount we use
            is fairly straightforward and intuitive.
        </p>

            If a more thorough treatment is needed, then depending on your goals,
            there are good options available.  For someone looking to explore
            some elementary probability theory, the introductory statistics textbook
              <url href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/"> <q>OpenIntro Statistics</q></url> by David Diez, Christopher Barr, and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel
            does a good job presenting this material.  It also is an excellent introductory statistics
            text with labs and data available.  For a calculus-based, theory heavy treatment
            of this subject, I recommend 
            <url href="https://www.markhuberdatascience.org/probability-textbook"> <q>Probability: Lecture and Labs</q></url>
            by Mark Huber.

        <statement>
            <p>In probability, an <term>experiment</term> is an  occurrence with a
                measurable result. Each instance of an experiment is  a <term>trial</term>. The possible results of
                each trial are called <term>outcomes</term>. The set of all possible outcomes for an experiment is the
                <term>sample space</term> for that experiment. </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-prob">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Given an experiment with sample space <m>S</m>:
            <ul>
              <li> An <term>event</term> <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>.</li>
              <li> Supposing each outcome in the sample space is equally likely, then the <term>probability</term> of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>P(A)</m> is <me>P(A)=\frac{|A|}{|S|}.</me>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
      </definition>

      <remark>
        <p>
          But what does it mean for an event <m>A</m> to have probability <m>P(A)</m>?  It means that if I repeat the experiment over and over, the proportion of them where <m>A</m> is true should be <m>P(A)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
        So if I roll a die over and over, the proportion of them that give me a 6 over time should be <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>.  So if we roll a dice 10000 times, we would expect one sixth of them to come up heads:

        <statement>
          <p>
            A <term>random variable</term> is a function from sample space to an outcome set.
            For our purposes, this set of outcomes will always be <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.

     </definition> 


     <p>
        A <term>probability distribution</term> is, roughly speaking, a complete description of a random variable and the likelihood of each output.  In the case of random variables with a finite number of possible outputs a <term>probability distribution table</term> is a convenient way of presenting this information.

        <statement>
          <p>
            To check if something is a valid probability distribution, for any possible outcome <m>x</m> of <m>X</m> we must have:
            <ul>
              <li><m>0\leq P(X=x)\leq1</m>.  This ensures all outcomes are valid probabilities.</li>
              <li><m>\sum P(X=x)=1</m>.  The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes should be 100% of the outcomes</li>
             </ul>

      <example xml:id="ex-apple">
        <title>Poisoned apples</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
        Snow White has a basket of 10 apples, 3 are poisoned.  She is going to pick 4 apples at random to eat for some reason.  Let <m>X</m> denote the number of poisoned apples she eats. 
      </p>
        <p>
        The probability distribution for <m>X</m> would be:
        <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}
        \hline
        x \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
        \hline
        P(X=x) \amp \frac{{3\choose 0}{7\choose 4}}{ {10\choose 4} } \amp \frac{{3\choose 1}{7\choose 3}}{ {10\choose 4} } \amp \frac{{3\choose 2}{7\choose 2}}{ {10\choose 4} } \amp\frac{{3\choose 3}{7\choose 1}}{ {10\choose 4} }\\
        \hline
        \end{array}
      </me>
      
      equivalently:
      
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}
        \hline
        x \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
        \hline
        P(X=x) \amp \frac{35}{210}\amp \frac{105}{210} \amp \frac{63}{210} \amp \frac{7}{210}\\
        \hline
        \end{array}
      </me>

      or:
      
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}
        \hline
        x \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
        \hline
        P(X=x) \amp \approx 0.1667\amp 0.5 \amp 0.3 \amp \approx 0.0333\\
        \hline
        \end{array}
      </me>
      
      </p>

      <p>
        This can be seen by the following R simulation:
        <sage language="r">
          <input>
n=1000
poison = 3
notpoison = 7
eat = 4

numpoison = rep(0, n)
poisonvec = rep(c(1),each=poison)
notpoisonvec = rep(c(0),each=notpoison)
applevec = c(poisonvec, notpoisonvec)

for(i in 1:n){
  numpoison[i] = sum(sample(applevec, eat, replace = FALSE))  
}
hist(numpoison)
          </input>
          <output>
          </output>
        </sage>
      </p>
    </statement>

      </example>

      <definition xml:id="def-expectation">
        <p>
      Given a finite random variable  <m>X</m>, its <term>expected value</term> is the predicted average outcome of experiments, and is computed: <me>E(X)=\sum P(X=x)\cdot x.</me>
    </p>
    
   
    </definition>

    <p>
      Note that the <q>Expected Value</q> may not be a value we actually expect, that is, may not be one of the outcomes, just an average outcome. We think of this as the outcomes of <m>X</m>, weighted by their likelihood, so the more likely outcomes contribute more than the less likely ones.
    </p>  
      
    <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
        Recall <xref ref="ex-apple"/>.  The expected value of poisoned apples would be <me>E(X)=0\cdot\frac{35}{210}+1\cdot\frac{105}{210}+2\cdot\frac{63}{210}+3\cdot\frac{7}{210}=1.2.</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can compute the mean of the previously simulated number of poisoned apples
        and visualize it:
        <sage language="r">
          <input>
hist(numpoison)
avgpoison = mean(numpoison)
abline(v = avgpoison, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = "red")
print(avgpoison)
          </input>
          <output>
          </output>
        </sage>
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to run the simulation in <xref ref="ex-apple"/> first!
      </p>
