<div class="para">A company produces three types of tires for the SUV market. In their manufacture, the tires are processed on two machines, a molder and a capper. Tire type A takes 8 hours in the molder, 4 on the capper and sells for $45.  Tire type B takes 10 hours in the molder, 7 on the capper and sells for $50. Tire type C takes 5 hours in the molder, 6 on the capper and sells for $40.  At least 75 of each type of tire needs to be made each week to fulfill current contracts.  If 3000 hours are available each week for molders and 2700 for cappers, how many of each type of tire should be made each week to maximize revenue?</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-exercisessimplex.html#exercise-18" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
