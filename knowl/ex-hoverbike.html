<div class="para">On the planet Zeltros, a luxury resort is preparing for a multi-day celebration they are hosting. One of the requested activities by the guests is hoverbike riding.  Over the three day event, they will require <span class="process-math">\(500\)</span> hoverbikes on the first day, <span class="process-math">\(300\)</span> hoverbikes on the second and <span class="process-math">\(800\)</span> hoverbikes on the final day.</div>
<div class="para">Brand new hoverbikes are <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> credits.  After use they undergo a maintanence procedure which costs <span class="process-math">\(250\)</span> credits and takes two days, before they may be used again.  A rush job that takes one day is possible but costs <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> credits.</div>
<div class="para">The resort naturally wishes to minimize their costs.  They wish to know how many bikes to purchase and what maintanence schedule would achieve this.</div>
<div class="para">Model this as a transportation problem where the “warehouses” are the number of brand new hoverbikes purchased before day 1, used hoverbikes from day 1 and used hoverbikes from day 2.  Can we make educated guesses on what these capacities should be?  What should the “markets” represent and what are their demands?  Then solve the problem.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-exercisestransports.html#ex-hoverbike" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
