<div class="para">Rowan picks an even integer from 1-10, and Colleen picks an odd integer from 1-10.  If the difference is less than 4, the player who played the bigger number wins the sum of the two values.

<div class="para">Rowan picks an integer from 1-3.  Colleen picks two guesses which may be the same.  Colleen reveals their guesses one at a time. If they guess correctly, they win $ equal to the value of their other guess.
