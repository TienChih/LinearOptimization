They may see their own card but not their opponenets.</div> <div class="para">Rowan now has three choices.  He may <em class="emphasis">FOLD</em>:  the pot goes to Colleen. He may <em class="emphasis">CHECK</em>: the pot remains as is, or he may <em class="emphasis">RAISE</em>: Rowan adds $2 to the pot.</div> <div class="para">If Rowan doesnâ€™t FOLD, Colleen also has three choices.  She may also <em class="emphasis">FOLD</em>: The pot goes to Rown.  She may <em class="emphasis">SEE</em>: Colleen adds money to the pot equal to what Rowan added (if any).  She may <em class="emphasis">SEE-RAISE</em>: Colleen adds money to the pot equal to what Rowan added, and then they both add in an additional $2.</div> <div class="para">If no one has folded at this point, the cards are revealed.
