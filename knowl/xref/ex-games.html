<div class="para">Rowan has a 3 of hearts, 4 of spades, 9 of spades  and 10 of hearts. Collen has a 5 of spades, 6 of hearts, 7 of hearts  and 8 of spades.</div> <div class="para">Each player selects a card without revealing it, and both players flip their cards over at the same time.  If the suits are the same, then Rowan wins the sum of the two card values. Otherwise, Colleen wins that sum.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">The same as (A) but reverse the payoff conditions for Rowan and Colleen.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Rowan picks an even integer from 1-6, and Colleen picks an odd integer from 1-6.  If the difference is less than 3, the player who played the bigger number wins the sum of the two values. Otherwise the player who played the smaller number wins the sum of the two values.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Rowan picks an integer from 1-3.  Colleen picks two guesses which may be the same.  Colleen reveals their guesses one at a time. If they guess correctly, they win $ equal to the value of their other guess. If they do not guess correctly, Rowan wins $ equal to the sum of both guesses.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading">

<div class="para">Colonel Rowan is attacking a town defended by Colonel Colleen.  Rowan has three regiments and Colleen has four.  There are two routes to the town. Rowan and select any number of regiments to attack along each route, up to a total of three and Colleen can likewise assign her four regiments along either route, neither knowing beforehand the otherâ€™s strategy.</div> <div class="para">Along each route, whatever side has a greater number of regiments wins points equal to the number of regiments sent by the opposing side (as they capture those units).  Furthermore, if Rowan wins along either route, he captures the town also worth one point.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading">

<div class="para">Rowan and Colleen each simultaneously hold up one or two fingers and shouts a guess for the total number of fingers held.  If either Rowan or Colleen guess correctly, then they collect $ from their opponent equal to this number of fingers. If they both guess correctly or both guess incorrectly, then no money changes hands.</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-exercisesgames.html#ex-games">in-context</a></span>
