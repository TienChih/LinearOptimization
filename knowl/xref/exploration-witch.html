<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">A witch named Agnesi is brewing a healing elixer and a poison.  A pint of healing elixer takes 3 newt eyes and one frog, whereas a pint of poison takes 1 each of newt eyes and frogs.  She currently has 34 newt eyes and 14 frogs.</div> <div class="para">Supposing that the healing elixer sells for three gold pieces, and the poison sells for two.  Agnesi wishes to maximzie her revenue.  Let us suppose that since these are liquids, she is happy making fractional amounts of elixers and potions.</div> </div>

<div class="para">Agnesi is frustrated by her production levels and income.  She is going to recruit some local children to gather more materials for her. Without explicitly computing anything, looking at her situation, what would result in greater profits for her, more newt eyes or frogs?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Recompute this linear program with 35 newt eyes and 14 frogs, then with 34 new eyes and 15 frogs.  Which provides the greater increase in revenue? Is this consistent with what you thought earlier?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">If the need for healing elixer increases and they now sell for 5 gold, would that change our answer?</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-section-sensitivity.html#exploration-witch">in-context</a></span>
