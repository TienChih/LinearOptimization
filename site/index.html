	      <em>Linear Optimization: A Geometric Inquiry Course</em> 
		  is an inquiry based learning text for an undergraduate course in 
		  linear optimization. Taking a geometric vantage point to build intuition, 
		  students work through a sequence of activities through which they discover and 
		  build the theory and concepts of the course. Numerous applications are also 
		  covered in the same manner. To reinforce the geometric and intuition building 
		  dimensions of the course, supplements in the form of videos and interactive 
		  elements are available through the open source, freely available online companion 
		  text.

	      <em> Linear Optimization </em> is an inquiry-based learning text.
		  The approach for this course is meant for those interested in either the theoritical
		  or practical facets of undergraduate linear optimization, and is appropriate for 
		  any student who has taken a linear algebra course.  
		  There is an emphasis on
		  developing geometric intuition and refining that intuition
		  into rigorous proofs, a valuable skill for any undergraduate math student.  
		  The book is designed for in class discussions between students
		  followed by individual study and practice.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      While the body of the text is structured as a series of activities, worked
		  through by students collaboratively, each chapter concludes with a summary chapter
		  and videos.  This scaffolds the learning experience and provides learners with resources
		  for individual review.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Each chapter contains numerous exercises with a variety of flavors,
		  computational, conceptual demonstration and proofs.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      To help develop intuition and ease computation, numerous interactive elements
		  from 
		   <a href="https://www.doenet.org/" target="_blank">
		Doenet
	      </a>
		  exercises,
	      <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank">
		Sage
	      </a>
	      cells and 
		  <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank">
		Desmos
	      </a>
		  interactives are included throughout the document.  These help students
		  to engage in inquiry via exploration, and see concretely how the geometric,
		  algebraic and computational elements of the course tie-in with each other.

				<q><em>Linear Optimization: A Geometric Inquiry Course</em> provides an 
				inquiry-based introduction to linear optimization (also called linear programming), 
				a rich and increasingly important topic with applications to economics, 
				computer science, biology, operations research, sociology, and numerous other areas. 
				The book is designed for active student engagement with a geometric perspective 
				in mind and is supported by a wealth of supplementary materials and interactive 
				tools through Doenet, Sage, and Desmos. 
				... By leveraging geometric intuition as its foundation, the content progresses from 
				geometry to linear algebra, proceeding from there to theory and 
				computation through explorations and activities. 
				This book is an excellent choice for instructors, students, and 
				readers who wish to develop their own deep understanding and appreciation of 
				linear optimization.</q>

				<q><em>Linear Optimization: A Geometric Inquiry Course</em> is a great addition to the library of inquiry-based textbooks. 
					The approach is consistent with the inquiry-based model of providing exploratory exercises for students to build a conceptual 
					understanding before developing the more theoretical aspects. 
					The main computational techniques are built through layers of activities that focus on building connections. 
					The text includes a wide variety of computational tools including optimization tools in Sage and a pivoting tool in the exercises. 
					The inclusion of Doenet interactives is very helpful for having students see the geometric side of linear optimization. 
					Beyond the standard concepts of canonical and noncanonical optimization problems, the Simplex algorithm, and duality, 
					the text includes a wide variety of 
					applications 
					including game theory, transportation problems, and network flows.
